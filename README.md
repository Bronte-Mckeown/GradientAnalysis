# Gradient Analysis
This repository contains all of the code (written collaboratively with Theo Karapanagiotidis) used to perform the group-level and individual-level gradient analysis on functional fMRI data as reported in Mckeown et al.(2020) using the BrainSpace Toolbox (Vos de Wael et al., 2019).
