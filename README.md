# Gradient Analysis
This repository contains all of the code (written collaboratively with Theo Karapanagiotidis) used to perform the group-level and individual-level gradient analysis on functional fMRI data as reported in Mckeown et al.(2020) using the BrainSpace Toolbox (Vos de Wael et al., 2019). 
## calculate_gradients
This script calculates group and individual level gradients
## spearman_gradients
This script calculates Spearman's rank correlation for each group and individual gradient
## AverageGradNiftis
This script calculates average gradient maps for the lowest and highest gradient similarity scores
