# Gradient Analysis
This repository contains all of the code (written collaboratively with Theo Karapanagiotidis) used to perform the group-level and individual-level gradient analysis on functional fMRI data as reported in Mckeown et al.(2020) using the BrainSpace Toolbox (Vos de Wael et al., 2019). 

If you use any of the code in your own work, please use the following reference to cite the work: Mckeown, B., Strawson, W. H., Wang, H. T., Karapanagiotidis, T., de Wael, R. V., Benkarim, O., ... & Bernhardt, B. (2020). The relationship between individual variation in macroscale functional gradients and distinct aspects of ongoing thought. Neuroimage, 117072.
